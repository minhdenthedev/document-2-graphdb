The House passed a bill Tuesday, 217-213, that would keep the government funded through September. The measure next heads to the Senate where prospects for passage remain uncertain as the threat of a shutdown looms.
House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Monday he’s confident a funding bill will pass this week ahead of the Friday deadline because “no one wants to shut the government down and we are governing, doing the responsible thing as Republicans.”
