Thousands of federal workers have been laid off or issued immediate termination notifications as part of President Donald Trump and Elon Muskâ€™s plan to cut spending and downsize the federal government.
CNN is tracking the chaotic and rapidly evolving situation at federal offices in Washington and across the United States, including the percentage of workers impacted at select agencies, reactions from fired workers and more context about the size of the federal workforce across all 50 states.

Methodology | CNN talked to federal agencies and impacted workers directly, analyzed dozens of statements and internal memos from government officials and evaluated additional reporting from Associated Press, NPR, Politico, New York Times, ABC News and Reuters to determine the approximate number of workers impacted from federal departments and agencies. These numbers are subject to change based on updated figures from government officials and various media reports, and in some instances, include announced firings or reports of announced firings. For this project, CNN is not tracking federal workers who are reinstated after their initial job impacts and is not tracking those placed on administrative leave or those who take voluntary buyouts.
